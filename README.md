This project is a remarkable achievement crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This endeavor represents my diligent efforts during Task 1 of my BharatIntern internship. With a focus on clarity and professionalism, I have successfully developed a robust application that seamlessly combines the power of these three technologies. It is with great pleasure that I present this project as a testament to my skills, dedication, and growth as an aspiring professional.
